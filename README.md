# Electromyogram_Signal_Analysis_Using_MATLAB
In this project i wrote a Matlab code that detects the Muscle disorder of a patient using EMG signals using signal abnormalities which were detected during signal propagation between nerve cells, we have compared the RMS, power spectrums of different patients EMG signals.
